	3.Do you know the Solution?
	Yes/No  - 
	
	4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
	Yes/No
	
	5. Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach)
	 Use ChatGPT to get approach or hints not the entire solution or complete code. USE THIS ONLY WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO GET THE APPROACH  FOR A GIVEN PROBLEM AFTER APPLYING ALL WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT AND PRACTICED + Remember how your brain is converting the test data input to its expected output!

	9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
	Done/Not Done - 
	
	10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
